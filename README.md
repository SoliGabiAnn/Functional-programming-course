# Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Lambda Expression
You are given a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student's name and their score.
Write a one-liner lambda function inside `sorted()` to sort the list **by the score in descending order**.

## Exercise 2 - Map
You are given a list of integers: `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Fill out the `map()` to create a new list where each number is squared. Then, fill out the other `map()` again to convert each squared number into a string formatted as `"Number: <n>"`.

## Exercise 3 - Filter
You are given a list of transactions presented as dictionaries.  **Filter** valid transactions (`status == "valid"`). Convert amounts from strings to floats. Apply a 10% tax to each valid amount. Format results as `"X z≈Ç"` strings.

## Exercise 4 - Currying and Decorators
You are given a ready `coffee_machine` function, ready `curry` decorator and an incomplete `validate_coin` decorator. Complete the `validate_coin` decorator so that it checks if number of coins is positive, and use both decorators to make the coffee machine function work just like in tests.

## Exercise 5 - Composing
You are given numerous, ready functions for text processing. Using composing create a pipeline to achieve required text formatting. *Note: You may need a function that's missing from the script.*
